# <strong>Node.js</strong> technology has been used to make this app. <strong><em>Node.js is a run-time environment of the JavaScript language. Through Node.js, we can execute JavaScript code on the server</em></strong>.

## Now let's talk about the codebase of this app.

- As you have already been told that <strong>Node.js</strong> has been used to make this app.

- If you want to execute this app on your system, then you have to first install two software named <strong>Node.js</strong> and <strong>Cmdr</strong>.

- Through <strong>Node.js</strong>, you will be able to write and execute server side JavaScript code and <strong>Cmdr</strong> will provide you a terminal.

- <em>Now you have to download this repo on your system</em>.

- After downloading the repo in the system, open this repo in a terminal named <strong>Cmdr</strong>.

- Once you have access to the <em><strong>index.js</strong></em> file of this repo, you will have to issue a command called <strong>npm install</strong> in the terminal itself. As soon as this command is issued, the dependencies of the app will be installed.

- Once all the dependencies are installed you will see that a new file named <strong>package.json</strong> has been created. This shows that all the dependencies have been installed.

- Now you have to issue a command named <strong>node index.js</strong> in the terminal.

- As soon as you issue this last command, the codebase of this app will start executing on your terminal.
